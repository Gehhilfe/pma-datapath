	\section{Color Conversion}
	Conversion form a 24 Bit rgb value to an 8 Bit grayscale value can be done with various precisions and methods. A example using double precision floats is given in octave \textit{rgb2gray}. This method uses a luminosity equation to compute the intensity for each pixel. We implemented the same equation using fixed point arithmetics. For this we firstly converted the luminosities factors for each color to 20 Bit integer value.
	\begin{align*}
		rf &= 0.29894_{10} \approx  0.01001100100001110101_{2} = 313461_{10} * 2^{-20} \\
		gf &= 0.58704_{10} \approx  0.10010110010010000100_{2} = 615556_{10} * 2^{-20} \\
		bf &= 0.11402_{10} \approx  0.00011101001100000111_{2} = 119559_{10} * 2^{-20} \\
	\end{align*}
	To test how different precisions for each factor perform we implemented a following octave function. The function takes an image and a 3x1 vector describing the bit precision for each factor from max 20 to 0. With this function we can test arbitrary bit length combinations.

\begin{lstlisting}
function [J] = ui8rgb2gray (I, bits)
rf = bitshift(uint64(313461), bits(1)-20);  # 0.01001100100001110101
gf = bitshift(uint64(615556), bits(2)-20);  # 0.10010110010010000100
bf = bitshift(uint64(119559), bits(3)-20);  # 0.00011101001100000111
uI = uint64(I);
for i = 1:rows(I)
	for j = 1:columns(I)
		r = rf * uI(i,j,1); g = gf * uI(i,j,2); b = bf * uI(i,j,3);
		J(i,j) = uint8(bitshift(r, -bits(1))) + uint8(bitshift(g, -bits(2))) + uint8(bitshift(b, -bits(3)));
	endfor
endfor
endfunction
\end{lstlisting}

    \subsection{Error Evaluation}

	The total error of rgb to grayscale conversion is a combination of the independent transformation for each channel. The total worst case error is the sum of all three partial worst case errors. Therefore to decide how many bits precision are need for each color channel, we did an error evaluation of each channel. For this we used three different metrics: Maximum Difference, Maximum Weighted Difference and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)

\paragraph{}
The Maximum Weighted Difference describes the error for a total converted image better then the other metrics. Because the total error of each channel does not effect the total error equal. The total error contribution is depends on the used conversion factors for each channel.
\begin{align*}
 \textbf{intensity} &= 0.29894*r + 0.58704*g + 0.11402*b
\end{align*}


Therefore the green channel twice the error contribution then the red channel and six times the contribution to the blue channel. Because this asymmetric error contribution we chose an asymmetric bit precision for each channel. We used for the green channel 7 Bit precision conversion factor, red channel 6 Bit precision conversion factor and for the blue channel only a 5 Bit precision conversion factor.

\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{gray_error} 
  \caption{Maximum difference, weighted maximum difference and RMS Error comparing octave rgb2gray and our implementation.}
\end{figure}


\subsection{C Implementation}

For the c implementation we used a straight forward two dimensional for loop that applies our conversion for each pixel. The rgb2gray function uses the same algorithm as our octave implementation. For validation we exported an small 15x15 image with octave as a constant static input array and printing the resulting array with printf. Therefor we could compare the results for all execution targets. For dynamic code tracing we used following bash script to count which and how many instructions are executed.

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}

\begin{lstlisting}
grep -n "cpu0" perf-transcript | awk '{print $7}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -hr
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
static inline uint8_t rgb2gray(const uint8_t *p) {
	const uint16_t Rc = 19; //0b0.010011
	const uint16_t Gc = 75; //0b0.1001011
	const uint16_t Bc = 3;  //0b0.00011
	uint8_t nR = (uint8_t)((Rc*p[0])>>6);
	uint8_t nG = (uint8_t)((Gc*p[1])>>7);
	uint8_t nB = (uint8_t)((Bc*p[2])>>5);
	uint8_t res = nR + nG + nB;
	return res;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

The result of dynamic tracing is attach as a file. Each instruction not executed and therefore not needed can be dropped. This simplifies the processor pipeline, but also restricts the functionality. These kind of optimization are only feasible for a FPGA, because removed instructions can be added again. 

\subsection{Datapath}
The mayor problem for the datapath construction is that the assigned amount of adders and multipliers are limited and free running. The consuming side of each pipeline can stall the processing at any time. Therefore there is two solution to consumer stall problem.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Free running pipeline with a consecutive memory element that can store all remaining intermediate result.
	
	\item Abstract the free running operators with a restore after stall logic. E.g. during a stall feed values in a cycle.  
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Decoupling Processing Stages with Shift Registers}

Shift Registers with intelligent clock enables can be used as an queue that doesn't need counters like a FIFO. I decided to use this kind of decoupling to fulfill adder limitation. For a efficient FIFO implementation with high bandwidth single cycle counters are needed.

\paragraph{Proposed decoupling shift register}
My proposed shift register works in two modes stalled and non stalled. For each data word register there is also a valid register. During non stall cycles elements are inserted at first taken space in the shift register chain and all stored value staring at this place to end are shifted. As opposite during stall cycles elements are added in the first space and all registers until the first invalid registers are shifted forward. The proposed decoupling element preserves sorting because at every time elements are added before the first all ready stored element. During non stall cycles the amount of stored elements stay constant, but free spaces is moved to the front. The amount of elements that can be stored during a stall increases.

\subsection{SLC Implementation}
The SLC implementation is a straight forward conversion of the C version. Because the grayscale conversion can be implemented embarrassingly parallel (map) by assign a micro thread to each pixel to convert. The thread index is used to load the input pixel color and to store after the conversion the intensity value.

\section{Histogram}
The computation of a histogram can be seen as a map reduce operation. Map converts a intensity to a bin index and the reduction counts the occurrence of each index. The map operation is again embarrassingly parallel. 

\subsection{Integer approximation}

The double precision value to bin map functions uses following equation: 

$f(x,b) = round(x*(b-1)/255.0)$

The rounding can be solved be using one bit more precision then needed, therefore the result would be fixed point number with single bit after the decimal point. This bit is one if decimal part is $0.5$ or larger. If this bit is one we easily add one to the integer part. Problematic is the division by $255_{10}=11111111_2$ this can not be implemented with a simple shift. It could be implemented by iterative shifting and subtraction. 

\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
static inline uint8_t maptobin(uint8_t p) {
	uint16_t bin = ((uint16_t)p) * (BINS-1);
	bin = (bin >> 8) + ((bin >> 7) & 1);
	return (uint8_t)bin;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{minipage}

\subsection{Error Evaluation}

We used in our fix point implementation division by 256 via a simple shift by 8. Because of this difference we assign some values to a lower bin. But for bin values $2^n+1 = {1,2,5,9,17,33,65,129}$ we get exactly the same result.
\begin{figure}[h!]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\linewidth]{histoerror}
	\caption{Mean Absolute Error over the 8 Bit value range.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Datapath}

The datapath for the histogram computation is split in two parts. The map part converting intensity values to bins and the reduction part counting bin occurrence. 

\paragraph{Map}

For the map part i used the same approach as before for the grayscale conversion. A free running pipeline with consecutive shift register decoupler. The pipeline consists of a single multiplier following an adder implementing the rounding. Input for the multiplier is the fixed value $BIN-1$ and the current intensity pixel. Input for the adder is the result of the multiplier shift by 8 and the result shifted by 7 bitwise and 1. This is equivalent to the C implementation. 

\paragraph{Reduce}

The counting of the bin occurrence is done in a Dual Port BRAM, that is extended with a bypass register to solve concurrent read and write of the same address. Without this bypass register the old value would be read and not the new values. Now it is possible to pipeline the counting with the following behavior. Every cycle a incoming bin is read for the BRAM on one port and in every cycle the read value is stored incremented by one. After an reset or start of frame the BRAM must be reseted to zero, for this the incoming data is stalled until all bins are zeroed.


\subsection{SLC Implementation}
To separated the two parts of the histogram computation we are using a communication channel between a parent and succeeding threads. Again we are decomposing the parallel data to a single data point for a single thread. A thread consists of two parts the parallel map from value to bin and the synchronized reduction. For the communication between threads a single shared and dependent register is used through which a pointer to the histogram array is forward. A threads receives the pointer through the shared register. After that the thread reads the bin and stores it incremented and finally forwards the pointer. The section between receiving and forwarding forms a critical section and possible read before write conflicts are solved.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
sl_def(histogram, void, sl_glparm(void*, glInput), sl_glparm(int, glBinMinusOne), sl_shparm(void*, shHistPtr))
{
	sl_index(i);
	uint8_t *in = sl_getp(glInput);
	uint16_t binMinusOne = sl_getp(glBinMinusOne);
	uint16_t binMinusOne = ((uint16_t)in[i]) * (bins);
	bin = (bin >> 8) + ((bin >> 7) & 1);
	
	uint8_t *histo = sl_getp(shHistPtr);
	histo[bin] += 1;
	sl_setp(shHistPtr, histo);
}
sl_enddef
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Sobel-Filter}

\begin{equation*}
G_x = S_x*A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 0 & -1 \\
2 & 0 & -2 \\
1 & 0 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix} * A
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
G_y = S_y*A = \begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 1 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \\
-1 & -2 & -1 \\
\end{bmatrix} * A
\end{equation*}

The Sobel-Operator is a stencil operation that computes gradient images. That can be used to implement an edge dection algorithm. The compute a single output value for the position $(x,y)$ the pixel and its eight neibourghs are neeed.

I propose an offset access function $O((x_1,y_1),((x_2,y_2)) = (x_1+x_2,y_1+y_2)$ that i will used to simplfy the convolutions to a simpler equation. For this i also used follwoing simplfication: $A_{x,y}(P) = A(O((P),(x,y)))$
\begin{equation*}
G_x = A_{-1,-1} + 2 A_{-1,0} +  A_{-1,1} -  A_{1,-1} - 2 A_{1,0} -  A_{1,1}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
G_y = A_{-1,-1} + 2 A_{0,-1} +  A_{1,-1} -  A_{-1,1} - 2 A_{0,1} -  A_{1,1}
\end{equation*}

\section{C-Implementation}

For the c implementation i used the algorithm described above. The resulting values have a signed range of $[-4\times255, 4\times255]$. To fit the signed back to an 8-Bit unsigned range of $[255,0]$, i shifted the negativ range to $0$ and scaled the range by $8$. Therefor a grandient result of $127_{10}$  means no gradient and results above this value mean a positive gradient and vice versa. The sobel algorith can be implemented without any multiplication by using shifts.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=C]
#define OFFSETACCESS(p, i, j, x, y) (p[(i+x) + (j+y)*HEIGHT])

int main(int argc, const char **argv) {
	int i, j;	
	uint8_t EX[(WIDTH-2)][(HEIGHT-2)];
	uint8_t EY[(WIDTH-2)][(HEIGHT-2)];
	uint8_t ginput[WIDTH*HEIGHT];
	for(i = 0; i < WIDTH*HEIGHT; ++i) {
		ginput[i] = i%2*127;
	}
	
	for(i = 1; i < WIDTH-1; ++i) {
		for(j = 1; j < HEIGHT-1; j++) {
			uint8_t p0 = OFFSETACCESS(ginput, i, j, -1, -1);
			uint8_t p1 = OFFSETACCESS(ginput, i, j,  0, -1);
			uint8_t p2 = OFFSETACCESS(ginput, i, j,  1, -1);
			uint8_t p3 = OFFSETACCESS(ginput, i, j, -1,  0);
			uint8_t p4 = OFFSETACCESS(ginput, i, j,  0,  0);
			uint8_t p5 = OFFSETACCESS(ginput, i, j,  1,  0);
			uint8_t p6 = OFFSETACCESS(ginput, i, j, -1,  1);
			uint8_t p7 = OFFSETACCESS(ginput, i, j,  0,  1);
			uint8_t p8 = OFFSETACCESS(ginput, i, j,  1,  1);
			int16_t ex = (int16_t)p0 - p2 + 2*p3 - 2*p5 + p6 - p8;
			int16_t ey = (int16_t)p0 + 2*p1 + p3 - p6 - 2*p7 - p8;
			ex += 4*255;
			ey += 4*255;
			ex /= 8;
			ey /= 8;
			EX[i-1][j-1] = ex;
			EY[i-1][j-1] = ey;
		}
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Datapath}

The sobel datapath is split in to two stages. First, i developed a stencil module that transforms the linear stream of pixels to a stream of neighbouring pixel. Second, this stag parallel maps operation are connected converting the neighbouring pixels to the resulting $G_x$ or $G_y$ value.

\paragraph{Conversion from sequetial pixel stream to parallel neighbour stream}

For this i implemented a parameterizable conversion module with the following parameters:
\begin{table}[h]
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|l|X|}
\hline
\textbf{Parameter} & \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
\hline
C\_ROW\_SIZE & The amount of pixels a single row \\ \hline
p\_dataBits  & The bit width of a single pixel \\ \hline
p\_rows      & The amount of neighbourhood row need to compute a single result \\ \hline
p\_cols      & The amount of neighbourhood cols need to compute a single result \\ \hline
\end{tabularx}
\end{table}


The conversion is done by using a shift register chain of $(C\_ROW\_SIZE-1)*p\_rows+p\_cols$ registers. The register chain stores pixel data, a valid flag and sof indicator. The first $p\_cols$ registers in each row is connected to the module output. On reset the registerchain is cleared.

\paragraph{Applying $Gx$ and $Gy$}
For the parallel  compution of $G_x$ and $G_y$ only three adders are used and none multipliers. From this three adders two are combinded to a three input adders with total latency of six. Four of the six time categories are used for the two postive and two negative partialsums(State Start\_A to Start\_D).  After that the unwind phase is entered. During unwind the last adder is used to do the value range conversion. This happends during the WAIT\_A and WAIT\_B state. The results are outputed during the DONE state until there are consumed. This module can only consume only one neighbourhood vector at a time and is not pipelined and each result computation takes 20 cycles.
\begin{figure}[h]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{circofsm.png} 
  \caption{FSM used for computing $G_x$ and $G_y$ with only three adders.}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Verfication}

This datapath is partly written in Verilog and SystemVerilog to improve my SV verfication skills. For verification some edge cases are used and random inputs. As edge cases inputs with all pixel equal are used, these should all result in a $G_x = 127, G_y = 127$ result. All results are evaluated agains a gold standard computed by system verilog.
